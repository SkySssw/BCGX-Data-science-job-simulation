again, we are using a `Random Forest` classifier in this example. A Random Forest sits within the category of `ensemble` algorithms because internally the `Forest` refers to a collection of `Decision Trees` which are tree-based learning algorithms. As the data scientist, you can control how large the forest is (that is, how many decision trees you want to include).\n","\n","The reason why an `ensemble` algorithm is powerful is because of the laws of averaging, weak learners and the central limit theorem. If we take a single decision tree and give it a sample of data and some parameters, it will learn patterns from the data. It may be overfit or it may be underfit, but that is now our only hope, that single algorithm. \n","\n","With `ensemble` methods, instead of banking on 1 single trained model, we can train 1000's of decision trees, all using different splits of the data and learning different patterns. It would be like asking 1000 people to all learn how to code. You would end up with 1000 people with different answers, methods and styles! The weak learner notion applies here too, it has been found that if you train your learners not to overfit, but to learn weak patterns within the data and you have a lot of these weak learners, together they come together to form a highly predictive pool of knowledge! This is a real life application of many brains are better than 1.\n","\n","Now instead of relying on 1 single decision tree for prediction, the random forest puts it to the overall views of the entire collection of decision trees. Some ensemble algorithms using a voting approach to decide which prediction is best, others using averaging. \n","\n","As we increase the number of learners, the idea is that the random forest's performance should converge to its best possible solution.\n","\n","Some additional advantages of the random forest classifier include:\n","\n","- The random forest uses a rule-based approach instead of a distance calculation and so features do not need to be scaled\n","- It is able to handle non-linear parameters better than linear based models\n","\n","On the flip side, some disadvantages of the random forest classifier include:\n","\n","- The computational power needed to train a random forest on a large dataset is high, since we need to build a whole ensemble of estimators.\n","- Training time can be longer due to the increased complexity and size of thee ensemble"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n","from sklearn.metrics import classification_report"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"metadata":{"id":"km_R7pYnUSKX"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Add model training in here!\n","model = RandomForestClassifier() #
